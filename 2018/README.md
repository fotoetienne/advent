# Advent of Code 2018

[https://adventofcode.com/2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018)

This year, I decided to implement the advent of code solutions in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

Each solution is a self-executing [kscript](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript) file.

Install kscript:
```
brew install holgerbrandl/tap/kscript
```

Run the solutions:
```
./01-chronal-calibration.kts
```
