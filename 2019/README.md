# Advent of Code 2019

[https://adventofcode.com/2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

Last year, I decided to implement the advent of code solutions in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). Keeping the tradition going this year.

Each solution is a self-executing [kscript](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript) file.

Install kscript:
```
brew install holgerbrandl/tap/kscript
```

Run the solutions:
```
./<problem-number>-<problem-name>.kts
```
